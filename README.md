# Uncertainty_Quantification_in_Shallow_Water_Model

This repository contains the implementation and analysis conducted as part of the Data Lab Project in Summer Semester 2024. The project focuses on using machine learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to improve the computational efficiency of weather forecasting in a shallow water model. The goal was to predict statistical metrics like mean and standard deviation for weather parameters such as wind velocity, cloud height, and rainfall.

The shallow water model, a simplified atmospheric model, was utilized to generate data for ensemble members, which allowed for the exploration of machine learning techniques to bridge the gap between accuracy and computational efficiency in weather forecasting.

### Key highlights of the project include:

- Statistical analysis on different ensembles to understand the behavior of weather parameters.
- Implementation of CNN and RNN models for sequential time-step prediction.
- Challenges in predicting standard deviation compared to mean values, particularly with limited data and hardware resources.
